##  User Story

AS A user
I WANT to search a book by title and read reviews
SO THAT I can decide whether or not to read the book

## Project Description
This webpage is for those who are looking for a specific book and possible buying options. 

When they search the title, they are provided a list of books that are related to the search with an image, title and author. When they select the book of choice they are shown the summary, author, page count, published year, and link to buy the book. 

There is also a bookmark button to add the book to the readlist which is under the hamburger menu. In the hamburger menu, the user is given a list of titles that they bookmarked along with an “edit list” option that allows the user to delete books from their list.
